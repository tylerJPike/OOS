Description: A structured and automated approach 
             to out-of-sample time series forecasting, a common, important, and subtle task. 
             The OOS package introduces a comprehensive and cohesive API for the out-of-sample forecasting workflow: 
             data preparation, forecasting - including both traditional econometric time series models and 
             modern machine learning techniques - forecast combination, model and error analysis, and 
             forecast visualization.
