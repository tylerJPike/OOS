Description: 
In many ways, this package is merely a wrapper for the excellent exant time series forecasting routines on 
CRAN -- including both traditional econometric time series models and modern machine learning techniques. 
However, this paradigm is meant to provide a structured approach to out-of-sample time series  forecasting, 
a common, important, and subtle task. This package further provides a modern and comprehensive set of forecast 
combination tools and forecast comparison metrics.
