Description: This package creates a paradigm to provide a structured and automatd approach 
  to out-of-sample time series forecasting, a common, important, 
  and subtle task. In many ways, this package is merely a wrapper
  for the excellent extant time series forecasting routines on CRAN -- 
  including both traditional econometric time series models and 
  modern machine learning techniques. However, this package additionally 
  provides a modern and comprehensive set of forecast combination 
  tools and forecast comparison metrics.
