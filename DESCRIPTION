Description: This package creates a structured and automated approach to out-of-sample time series forecasting, a common, important, and subtle task. In many ways, this package is merely a wrapper for the excellent extant time series forecasting routines on CRAN - including both traditional econometric time series models and modern machine learning techniques. However, this package additionally provides a modern and comprehensive set of forecast combination techniques and forecast analysis tools.
